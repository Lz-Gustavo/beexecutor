# beexecutor
*beexecutor* implements an experimental prototype to evaluate [beelog](https://github.com/Lz-Gustavo/beelog) **ConcTable** algorithm over a series of configurable workloads and scenarios. Suiting different needs of experimentation, *beexecutor* offers:

* **exec:** A single node key-value store, parsing static input logs pre-generated by a personal fork of [go-ycsb](https://github.com/Lz-Gustavo/go-ycsb). Outputs a series of data measuring *beelog* efficiency (i.e. throughput, latency) against a standard logging scheme;

* **check:** A log verifier script, that statically analyses generated log files from **exec** to conjecture about recovery implications of *beelog*;

* **scripts:** Simple bash scripts to facilitate experimentation process and configuration;

* **[WIP] etcd client:** Parses the same static input logs, proposing values to [etcd](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd) key-value store.
